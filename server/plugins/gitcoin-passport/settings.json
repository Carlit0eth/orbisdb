It is a way to collect and present data without exposing it or giving up ownership. Under the hood, it is a unique decentralized identifier (a DID) associated with your Ethereum address, stored on the Ceramic network. The DID can be used to look up a user's Stamp data, which exists as a collection of Verified Credentials. Verified Credentials do not contain any personal identifying information! They simply demonstrate, using a cryptographic signature, that the user gave access to a specific app and that some criteria were met.",
